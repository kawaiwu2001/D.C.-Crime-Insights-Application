# D.C Crime Insights Application

## Project status

As of 12/11/2024 the team will no longer be working on the project. Additionally, the database will be shut down after the final project is graded because we are currently paying to use Amazon RDS resources by having it deployed on the internet. If you desire to fork the project, the crime_database.py file can be used to create tables in a new database by changing the credentials, using the various functions defined in the file, and by downloading the csv files from where we gathered our data from: https://crimecards.dc.gov/. However, changes the application must not be used for commercial use and must follow our creative license http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/.

## Description

The D.C. Crime Insights Application can be used to analyze valuable data regarding D.C. crime statistics. The application has multiple different pages that serve different functions

### Features

- Dashboard: Provides high livel information such as general statistics over the past 30 days, Past 12 months, and Crime Trends over the past few years using a variety of different graphs to diplay information in a clean and concise format.
- CrimeMap: This page

## Installation

Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage

Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support

Project was developed by Capstone Group 10 - CS 5934. For more information about the project, you can contact our professor ssibdari@vt.edu as team members emails will be depricated in the near future.

## Roadmap

Regarding future works for the application. We believe that it would be a good idea to use polynomial regression for different crime methods on the Crime Prediction Linear Regression Graph. Additionally, on the Saftery Routing Page, we generate a new route for the user that takes into account local crime data over the past 7 days. However, our application does not show the original route generated before taking into account the crime data. This may be a good feature to add to the application.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
